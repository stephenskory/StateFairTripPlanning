# Optimal State Fair Trip Planning

[Stephen Skory](https://stephenskory.com/)

This repository contains a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
that shows how I performed the calculations
posted in [this blog post](https://stephenskory.com/2016/08/11/state-fair-trip-planning/).

In my opinion, the easiest way to run the notebook for yourself is to download and
install [Anaconda Python version 2](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
This will include numpy, networkx, 
You may also need to install on your system:

  * [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/)
  * [pydot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydot)
  * [nxpd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nxpd)
  * [googlemaps](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/googlemaps)
